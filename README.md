# MyGPURaytracer
A high performance raytracer programmed with CUDA.  The implementation of  the paper "[Edge-Avoiding A-Trous Wavelet Transform for fast Global Illumination Filtering](https://jo.dreggn.org/home/2010_atrous.pdf)".

This branch conflicts with the master branch and should not be merged.

## Features

* Monte Carlo based ray tracer on GPU;
* BSDF Evaluation: pure diffuse, reflection and refraction, diffuse+specular;
* Arbitrary .obj model file loading with its emissive, specular,diffuse,bumping textures;
* Depth of field
* GPU improvement: stream compaction
* Cache first intersection
* Material sort

## Usage

Only support win32ï¼š

Raytracer.exe directory/to/scene.txt

executable directory example:

```
